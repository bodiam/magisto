# TO DO

## Improvements

In arbitrary order, all not yet very clear:

* Put configuration defaults in a file called `.magisto`.
* Ignore specific files based on wildcards (like `.gitignore`, but then in `.magisto`)
* Custom templates on directory level by putting a `.page.ftl` in that directory
* Custom templates for specific files by putting a `<file>.ftl` next to the file
* Formally support including template files in the other templates.
* Index pages: generate overview pages of all pages and directories in a directory, using a special index template
* Built-in macro's and/or directives for the FreeMarker template
* Custom names for default Magisto files (`.page.ftl`)
